# ZenTrades Dashboard - React with Tailwind CSS

This project creates a React dashboard application with login functionality and data visualization using charts and dropdowns built as components. Tailwind CSS is used for utility-based styling.

Installation:

Clone this repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
Use code with caution.

 Navigate to the project directory:

Bash
cd <your-repo-name>
Use code with caution.

Use code with caution.

 Running the Application:

Start the development server:

Bash
npm start
Use code with caution.

 This will launch the application in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.

Features:

Login: Users authenticate with a username and password (currently a placeholder).
Forgot Password: Clicking the "Forgot your password" link opens an email client to send an email to support@zentrades.pro (requires email client configuration).
Dashboard: Renders various components for data visualization and interaction.

Tailwind CSS:

Tailwind CSS provides utility classes for styling. Configuration is located in tailwind.config.js.

Authentication (Optional):

Currently, a placeholder login system exists. Replace it with a more secure mechanism (e.g., form-based login with API integration).

Forgot Password Link:

Clicking the link opens the user's default email client with a pre-filled email address (support@zentrades.pro) but doesn't send an actual email. Configure your email client to handle this behavior.
